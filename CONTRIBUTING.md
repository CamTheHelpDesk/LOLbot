## Ideas
Have a great idea for a new feature for the bot, but don't know how to code? Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/CamTheHelpDesk/LOLBot/issues/new) and describe your idea. The community will discuss it and add it to the bot if we decide like it. However, if you know what you are doing, feel free to open a Pull Request and demonstrate how you think the code should work! (Read below for more info!)

## Reporting Bugs
I really appreciate it when people find bugs and report them to me. If you find a bug in the code, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/CamTheHelpDesk/LOLBot/issues/new). You can just follow the bug report template we have to make everything easier for everyone.

## Writing Code
I could always use some help with writing code for the bot. Because I want to focus on the development of LOLBot, I'm not going to take any time to document the bot except for commenting my code (but, if you want to work on documentation, feel free). However, the bot is simple enough that a quick look at the code should get you up and running. If you are interested in contributing, please read instructions below for more information!

> Don't want to go through the hastle of cloning the project and installing modules? [Click here](https://repl.it/github/CamTheHelpDesk/LOLBot) to automagically clone the project to repl.it so you can easily edit the bot and make a pull request!

### Instructions
If you know how to code in JavaScript using `Node.js` and `Discord.js`, then feel free to give one of the [issues](https://github.com/CamTheHelpDesk/LOLBot/issues) a try, or see if you can fix anything proposed by [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/CamTheHelpDesk/LOLBot/issues). Fork this repository, make some changes and then open a pull request!

> Keep in mind that this bot is hosted on `repl.it`, using the `Hacker` plan. Take that into account when you're writing code!

### Additional Rules, Guidelines, and Notes for Code Contributors
* **ALWAYS SIGN YOUR COMMITS!** You *must* sign your commits to this repository.
* Please make sure you lint your code! (`npm run lint`, or `npm run lintfix` to auto fix any issues it finds)
